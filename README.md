# Vision--Quality-evaluation-of-cakes

Evaluation on quality control and positioning of the cake production line.
The main objectives of the work were to perform a quality control of the cakes and the positioning of the good cakes. It also had another objective, as a voluntary extension, to calculate the center of each of the cakes in a set of them.
The quality control of the cakes should be done by detecting those that do not meet a minimum quality. Their failures can be indicators of a cake that is pierced, raw, deformed, broken or burned. If you do not have any of these failures, it is considered good.
